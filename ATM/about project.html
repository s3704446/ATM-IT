            <h2>Project Name</h2>
            
            <p>ATM Sneakers App</p>

            <!--project description-->
            <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
            <p> The reason why our group has chosen this project is because currently there aren’t many platforms  that  targets  specifically  towards  the  buyer  and  seller  for  sneakers.  And  this project idea also relates to our group member’s individual interest as sneaker collectors. This project is also able to enrich our IT skills because currently the knowledge required to create this project is beyond our skill level.</p>
