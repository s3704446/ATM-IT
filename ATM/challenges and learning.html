        <h2>What we found easy</h2>
        <p>We found it easy to communicate with each other because we had been good friends since before this course. In team work, we are able to maintain good communication, discuss problems in the project, and help solve others' problems. Get better team work.We found that it was easy for us to build a web page, because we had the foundation and experience of web design before, so it was easy for us to design a web page.</p>
        
        <h2>What we found difficult</h2>
        <p>We found that the whole project design and planning is difficult for us, because we have not done the project experience, at the beginning of the project, some do not know how to start, everyone has their own ideas and planning, integration of everyone's ideas and planning is difficult, so we need to keep good cooperation and it consumes us a lot of time and energy to study.We used Github to design the website before, but this time we needed to build the website on AWS. We had no experience in using AWS before, which was a challenge for us. We had to learn everything from scratch.Application design is a challenge for us. We are better at web design. For application design, we don’t have a lot of experience. During the project, we spend a lot of time to learn. Fortunately We are good at the report part and saved a lot of time.</p>
        
        <h2>What we expected</h2>
        <p>We expect that all the functions in the plan may encounter problems, especially the application design, because we have no experience in designing applications, so we spent a lot of time learning and testing during the project.</p>
        
        <h2>What we did not expect</h2>
        <p>We didn’t expect web design to be a challenge for us, because we used GitHub to design web pages. For AWS, everyone used it for the first time and lacked experience, so that we spent the first job. A lot of time to learn AWS.Another challenge is that some members of our team are not in Melbourne due to the impact of the epidemic. The time difference and VPN caused some impact on our communication and caused some work delays.</p>
        
        <h2>New skills and experience that we have learned</h2>
        <p>Through this project, we learned a lot of new knowledge and skills, such as how to better communicate with teammates in team work, how to better conduct team work, and also learned many skills. Through this project, we can improve I am good at web design, and I am gradually familiar with the java part I am not good at.</p>
        
        <h2>Things have not worked out for us</h2>
        <p>We plan to design and build a prototype that is truly fully usable by the customer, but due to time and resource constraints and unexpected challenges, we cannot fully implement the plan. We have implemented the rough design and testing. However, we cannot connect the mobile client to the back-end service to complete a complete end-to-end working prototype. So we only designed a prototype, and did not really complete the program.</p>
        
        <h2>Plan changes / What we would have changed to the plan</h2>
        <p>If we are aware of these challenges, as well as our limited time and resources, as well as the ongoing problems of the project, then we will modify the scope of the project appropriately. We will turn the program into a web application. Because we are more 
familiar with the design of web applications, this will save us a lot of time, and the time saved can be better used for application design and development. When the web application development is completed, when time permits, we will extend it to the mobile client to realize the development of the entire project.</p>
        
        <h2>Was our timetable realistic</h2>
        <p>When the project is completed, look at our timetable. Many parts of our timetable are unrealistic, because we did not take into account the problem of time difference, which caused some work delays, and we spent a lot of time on studying and reducing Time for our development. And there were too many plans at the beginning of the project to be fully realized in the end.</p>
        
        <h2>Have the tools and technologies worked out as expected</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of the project, we expected the tools and technologies to be used,using invision to design the user interface, and using php to design the website. We have used these tools very well, but in the process, our technology gradually began to fail. Cope with the development of the project, so we spent a lot of time in the process of the project to learn new technologies. But we still couldn't implement the entire program exactly as planned. We only completed the prototype of the entire program, and couldn't really do it like an app on the market. For us, the issue of jet lag is unexpected. When we started to plan our time, we did not consider the impact of jet lag, which caused some difficulties for us.</p>
