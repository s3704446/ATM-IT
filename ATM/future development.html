        <p>Now our program only has the ios app version. If we want to design a multi-platform app in the future, we need more code experience on windows and Android platforms. And because our app is a third-party website, and there are many similar apps on the market, we need to add more unique features to attract user groups, or use some special features to target special groups. For example, for students or office workers or even the elderly. Another challenge is that we need a huge database to store our user information, which means that our funds need to increase and we need to have database design experience. We also need network security-related experience to keep our user information from being stolen by hackers.</p>
