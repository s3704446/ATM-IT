         What have you learned about group projects? What has worked well in your group? What has not worked well?
Working as a group for the last 12 weeks, some of the things that we have learned about group projects are:
Organization: In each group meeting everyone is very active organization and participation.
We all helped each other out in difficult problems.

Team communication: Each person's opinion is particularly important in the discussion of the group. We actively discuss and solve problems no matter in class or after class. The group members can give each other better Suggestions

Time management: We attach great importance to the time management of assignments. We put the things to Trello that should be done every week carefully so that it is very clear.
The communication between everyone in our group is efficient. Everyone can come up with good ideas. Everyone can point out a problem or fix a deficiency. The communication and reply after class are also very quick.
For the time management problems our team faces. In this way, we can pay attention to the assignments every week. We can not only ensure the quality of the assignments, but also correct the assignments in time so that you will not do badly because you do not have enough time.

What were the groupâ€™s processes for communication? How were they? Have there been any changes since the start of the semester?
Our group communicated with each other through WeChat, and all the members reminded us of the information, so we all replied very quickly. We start every week with a discussion in WeChat. We also tried to use Trello for discussion but found it convenient to use WeChat because Trello does not allow too much text for discussion.

From your experience in this project, what is the most important aspect of organizing a project of this nature? Is there anything that you would do differently if you were to start again?
 
From our group's experience of this project, time management is very important for us. We should try to finish the task one week before the deadline, so that we still have time to discuss and revise. We worked ahead of time through Trello's schedule, and we tried our best to finish the work a few days before the scheduled time, which was also convenient for the weekly teacher meeting.

What advice would you give to a group about to embark on a similar project?
For the assignment of tasks, the key is also for the efficiency of the task, according to each person's ability to assign the corresponding task. Use Trello for task assignment and time planning. Reduce quality degradation due to lack of time.
