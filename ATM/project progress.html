        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            First,  we  held  a  group  meeting  to  discuss  the  theme  of  the  project.  After  discussion,  we finally  chose  the  app  for  selling  sneakers,  because  sneakers  are  not  only  the  common hobby of our team members, but also the market of this kind of APP in Australia isalmost blank.Then  we  got  into  the  planning  phase  and  discussed  the  features  needed  for  the app.This step is not very smooth, because we have never done this kind of project before, so  we  can  only  determine  the  function  we  need  by  analyzing  other  apps  ofthe  same type.Over  time,  we  listed  the  necessary  features,  as  well  as  some  extensions.Then  we listed  the  steps  required  for  the  development  of  each  function,  among  which  the  time 
planning was a difficult problem for us, because we did not know how to manage the time properly. This problem was clearly exposed in the later steps.Then  we  started  developing  the  project.  In  the  part  of  the  website,  some  of  our  team members are good at  web  page programming, so we went smoothly in this part,  but we did  not  know  how  to  upload  to  AWS.  However,  this  problem  was  solved  in  a  very  short time.At  the  same  time,  we  were  developing  the  APP.  We  divided  tasks  equally  among each  team  member  and  insisted  on  meeting  at  least  once  a  week  to  exchange  problems we encountered.But  the  process  is  not  very  well,  first  of  all,  we  don't  know  how  to  design  animationwas solved only after this on consulting a large amount of data, but it took us a lot of time to learn, cause is not completed within the prescribed period of time needed for the project, which  affect  the  later  development  stage,  cause  the  backlog  of  projects,  and  even  some demand  missed  the  delivery  time  stipulated  by  the  customer,  the  problem  continues  to affect  our  to  the  end  of  the  project,  we  regret  that  we  failed  to  complete  the  scoring system  and  shielding  word  check  system.  We  have  also  made changes  to  the  project content.  For  example,  we  planned  to  allow  QR  code  functionality  during  the  project planning  phase,  but  that  was  so  much  beyond  our  capabilities  that  we  had  to  replace  it with another achievable feature.In   this   project,   we   learned   a   lot   of   experience   and   knowledge,   especially   project management.At  the  same  time,  we  have  learned  many  valuable  lessons,  especially  time management.This will  be of great help to  our future projects, so that we can  finish themmore efficiently.
