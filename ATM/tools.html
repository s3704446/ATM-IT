            <h2>Resource and Tools</h2>
                <h4>Github: </h4>
                    <p>We will use GitHub to build dreft website for this project. GitHub is a web tool that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. The reason we use GitHub is we are familiar to use this tool after finish Intro to IT course. GitHub is also a feel tool to store our code for our project. 
                    The reason why we don't use another web design tool like Wix  (https://www.wix.com/professionalwebsite/leader-topten) is we have no experience to use this tool before, it could cause some unexpected mistakes when we create our website. </p>
                
                <h4>Invision:</h4>
                    <p>Invision is used to design the user interface of the app and to animate the page.  </p>

                <h4>MS Visual Studio Code</h4>
                <p>We use this software fore web programming.</p>

            <!--Group Contract-->
            <h2>Group Contract</h2>
            <h3>Communication Expectations</h3>
            <p>We have weekly group meeting in Sunday, every group member will join and share inspirations and what every member have done in this week. We also have 3 different tiny groups within 2 members to work together for this project. Deyang bao and Zixun Zhou have response to think about the main project designs. Yuliang Lei and Qiheng Chen in the role with design group website and HTML designs. Zhentao Ma and  Haoming Tian take part in think about project risks and how to solve problems. </p>
            <h3>Decision-making Processes</h3>
            <p>All project decisions have been put forward with group members and our group decide if we take this decision and how we process it. Every week we have new decisions put out and some are already taken part in our project. Yuliang Lei   decide most part of project decision, other group members help him figure out how to achieve this decision in project. 
                <br>For example, Lei decide we need to add social feature in our project, and Chen thinks our app can ask to take location information from users and ask them if they want to share it to another user whom bought same product.
